I'm a Jordanian male, studied Industrial Engineering at the university of Jordan, enrolled at the university by 1993, and graduated by 1998, I liked the topics related to computer and automation as well as operations analysis, my graduation project was "Buding a simulation software for the control lab experiements" so that it be used instead of the physical appartements in order to reduce their maintemance cost, my graduation project had won the third rank at the first creative Arab students conference that had been held in Amman-Jordan by 1998.
I started my work as Operations engineer at PETRA Engineering Industries by Oct 1998, a leading HVAC manufactured at the middle east, the main target of m job was building the production schedules for PLANT-B that is dedicated in assembling the big chillers and package units, in synergy with the production plan for PLANT-A that is dedicated for preparing sheet metals, coils and fans that are required for building the chhillers and packages, as will as in synergy with design documents release plans, as well as material issues and purchase department and customs clearance plans for getting th eimported material, PLANT-B was having sheet metal assemnly, pipes preperation, welding and refrigeration, electrical panels preperation and electrical wiring and comminssion section for testing the units before mving them to the packaging and shipping departments, we executed succesffuly some landmark projects like LAX and RAND corporate.
By Feb 2003 I left PETRA to RISCO in Kuwait, which is also working as HVAC manufacturer along with ducts manufacturing and cold storage and distribution, but PETRA is a building a custom made an dtailered machines, while RISCO is building standard machines, PETRA is working on the make to order bases, while RISCO is working on the make to stock concept, PETRA is building machines that are targetting commercial buildings, while RISCO is building machines that are targetting residential villas, PETRA is applying a workstation assemply concept where the base of the machine is located at a special location at the assembly area and all the production and assembly processes happening there, while RISCO is following the assembly line concept, where the base of the machine is located at a conceyer that is moving across all the production stations.
At RISCO I started woking as Production Planning and Control Engineer, that taking care of planing and controlling both material movment, ordering and stocking, as well as production plans, by 2006 I got promoted as purchase in-charge due to the lack of the support we used to got from th eprocurement team, and the objective of promoting me was to ensure smooth supply of meaterial to both production loines and projects. 
At PETRA I carried out a time and motion study to reduce the 7 wastes, and as an outcome of this study I developed a production lines balancing software using MS Access and VB that is feeded by the configuration of the machine, and provided a work load points for each process for each department, and based on the avaiable resources at each department is makes the production plan, this system/software improved the scheduling process, reduced the production lead time, and increased promised delivery dates fulfilment, as well as increasing the production area space utilization by optimizing the number of assembly stations that are built in it.
At RISCO I played an important role for the migration from the MICROS system to the ORACLE ERP system , taking care of all the process related to the supply chain and operations functionalities, inventory, BoM, production and procurement, while leading this part of implementation, I was part of a VE/VA team that took responsibility for BoM audit and product costing, my contribution made a great improvements at the BoM structure as well as consuming ~1M $ of the slow moving and dead inventory. At RISCO I waorked with mutlti cultural and belives teams for the first time in my life, and managed my relations professionaly without any bias.

At NALCO the diversity of the teams I worked with had been increased, but kept the same level of professionalisim, at NALCO I worked with SMART KPIs, and objectives, dashboards and data-driven actions, I also developed a software to help me at the material inventory management for repacking the products that are having similar chemistry but different names and packaging to avoid expiry
By Nov 2014 I moved to Canada fro personal issues, then back to Saudi by Jan 2015 as Supply chain and ERP manager at B&K, a plastic bags manufacturer for the petrochemical industries, I estableshed the supply chain department from scratch and lead the ERP implenentation project, and I buit the required custom reports, at this company I develoed a vendor managed  inventory system where the user having access to our system data that is related to his items, with thier stock level and consumption rates, so he achieve JIT supply. Also I built a web based dashboard that is having a voice interaction with the user, and providing a real time data and insights about the operation. I left B&K by May 2017 to join BASF Construction Chemicals as a Supply Chian Manager, where BASF got acquired  construction chemical factories and wanted them to follow its standard, so I wokrd in restructuring the supply chain team, preparing job descriptions and standard operational proceedures, along with coaching and mentoring the team, theis helped me getting another job so I left by Aug 2018 and joined directly another company as VP, that company name is United Arab Float Glass manufacturing, it is located at Yanbu, and as a VP I was loking for Supply Chian, IT and Projects Management, coaching and mentoring the team, but unfortunatly duo the negotiation with another company to acquire this factory I felt my position is at risk and better to find another job, so I left directly after completing my 1st year contract by Aug 2019, and joint another comoany at Oct 2019 called Aujan Industrial Solutions, I joined them as a Supply Chian Manager,  it is the first time I'm working at the retail industry, it is an SHE company that is working mainly at providing PPEs and fire protection and preventive equipments, it sell others and managing consignment locations for one of the biggest refineries at the west area of Saudi Arabia, along with handling fire and Gas projects, they are a partner and distributer of some main safety products manufacturer, my role as Supply Chian Manager focused on establishing supply chain department, that is having resilliance and agility as main pillars, I developed a supply chain control tower to help me manage the operation and having a real time communication and updated information with the stackholders, helping the management building a performance management system for the compnay, and controlling cash flow and expenditures.
By Oct 2022 my contract had not been renewed due to COVID-19, and low sales, where the company could not manage my salary.
I started searching for any job that could help me manage my expenses requirements, so I joined a software development company, this compamny is named ALFALA, it is a golden partner for Microsoft, and they are working as implemnter and customizer of D365FO, I joined them as a Support Leader and project mananger and product mananger, to lead the invovation process and vertical expansions of the system along with managing the relationship with the customers, I automated the ticking system, and controlled projects costing, I lead the development process of the E-invoicing Solution that is matching with ZATCA requirements, I also built a mobile-workforce management system that is managing the tasks given to the teams at fields, as well as monitoring their location and load, also I built a vendor collaboration system, also I build a customer service chat bot that is is using chatGPT, and the company data to interact with the client through WhatsApp, also I build an AI app that is using the timeseries parameters and attributes to provide proper demand forecast.
I'm faced an issue after that my cv is looks confusing for some people, am I a supply chain professional or an IT professional, I need you to help me in this, you ar eok to provide 2 copies of the resume or more, also the short work periods after leaving NALCO looks to be impoacting my marketability negativily!
I was thinking that mentioning the multiple industires I worked with, anlong with th ehigh diversity of teams I worked with and managed, could be a helpful factor to increase my potential in having a good job, I'm intereted in career growth after reaching a VP position, but afraid that the positions after it could be considered as downgrading! at the same time some companies may look for being a VP as over qualified. Also i do not need the recruiters to understand from my last job at software development that I stepped away from the supply chain area.
I need your quidlines how to proceed.
